  abstract = {Electrical and mechanical power, together with other forms of useful work, are generated worldwide at a rate of about 1012 watts, mostly using heat engines. The efficiency of such engines is limited by the laws of thermodynamics and by practical considerations such as the cost of building and operating them. Engines with high efficiency help to conserve fossil fuels and other natural resources, reducing global-warming emissions and pollutants. In practice, the highest efficiencies are obtained only in the most expensive, sophisticated engines, such as the turbines in central utility electrical plants. Here we demonstrate an inexpensive thermoacoustic engine that employs the inherently efficient Stirling cycle1. The design is based on a simple acoustic apparatus with no moving parts. Our first small laboratory prototype, constructed using inexpensive hardware (steel pipes), achieves an efficiency of 0.30, which exceeds the values of 0.10--0.25 attained in other heat engines5,6 with no moving parts. Moreover, the efficiency of our prototype is comparable to that of the common internal combustion engine2 (0.25--0.40) and piston-driven Stirling engines3,4 (0.20--0.38).},

This new engine outperforms previous thermoacoustic engines, which are based on standing waves and intrinsically irreversible heat transfer, by more than 50. At its most efficient operating point, it delivers 710 W of acoustic power to its resonator with a thermal efficiency of 0.30, corresponding to 41 of the Carnot efficiency. At its most powerful operating point, it delivers 890 W to its resonator with a thermal efficiency of 0.22. The efficiency of this engine can be degraded by two types of acoustic streaming. These are suppressed by appropriate tapering of crucial surfaces in the engine and by using additional nonlinearity to induce an opposing time-averaged pressure difference. Data are presented which show the nearly complete elimination of the streaming convective heat loads. Analysis of these and other irreversibilities show which components of the engine require further research to achieve higher efficiency. Additionally, these data show that the dynamics and acoustic power flows are well understood, but the details of the streaming suppression and associated heat convection are only qualitatively understood.}},

The combination of all these oscillations, and their interaction with solid boundaries, produces a rich variety of “thermoacoustic” effects. Although these effects as they occur in everyday life are too small to be noticed, one can harness extremely loud sound waves in acoustically sealed chambers to produce powerful heat engines, heat pumps and refrigerators. Whereas typical engines and refrigerators have crankshaft‐coupled pistons or rotating turbines, thermoacoustic engines and refrigerators have at most a single flexing moving part (as in a loudspeaker) with no sliding seals. Thermoacoustic devices may be of practical use where simplicity, reliability or low cost is more important than the highest efficiency (although one cannot say much more about their cost‐competitiveness at this early stage).}},

Measurements are reported of a modified version of the Space Thermo-Acoustic Refrigerator (STAR), driven at peak-to-mean pressure ratios up to 6. This pressure ratio corresponds to 30 W of cooling power—five times as large as reported for STAR in 1993. The results of these measurements are compared to a DELTAE computer model of the low-amplitude (linear) performance that matches experimental conditions on a point-by-point basis. It is found that there is a small but measurable deviation in heat pumping power from the power predicted with a linear acoustic computer model at moderate amplitudes. This deviation in heat pumping power at 6 pressure ratio is about 23. A large disagreement in the acoustic power needed to attain a specific pressure ratio is found between measured data and DELTAE results. An overview of the instrumentation, including a measurement of exhaust heat with an absolute accuracy of 65 mW, is also presented.}},

Simulations based on linear thermoacoustic theory have also been done for comparison with experimental results, which shows reasonable agreement within a certain pressure wave amplitude range and cold end temperature range.

A thermoacoustic refrigeration system uses no refrigerant but is currently not a feasible solution due to the still immature technology with much still unknown about the theories that explain the thermoacoustc cooling effects and the desired performance. This paper reviews past studies to achieve the desired outputs; lowest temperature, the highest temperature difference generated across the stack, the lowest acoustical work required for cooling, or/and the highest coefficient of performance (COP) of the standing wave thermoacoustic refrigerator and various attempts at optimization in terms of the many parameters that represent the outcomes. The review looked at methods employed to analyze the performance with discussions on the relevant parameters that must and have been be considered by past researchers. To date, most studies have been focused on the stack, the heart of the system. Optimization work has been performed parametrically, experimentally or/and numerically, where discrete variations of the parameters investigated are completed whilst others are held constant. Lately, genetic algorithm, a statistical approach, has been utilized in simultaneous optimization of the parameters of the desired outputs where conflicting objectives are possible. To date, thermoacoustic refrigerator remains an attractive alternative technology towards a global agenda of a more sustainable future.}

This paper summarizes recent development with regards to the designing and the performance of highly efficient traveling-wave thermo-acoustic refrigerators. Past studies discussing devices outputs namely the lowest temperature achieved, the cooling power and the coefficient of performance of travelling-wave refrigerators, are described. The review looks at the performance and the geometrical configuration of devices developed by previous researchers. A summary of the optimization targets and the outcomes achieved is described. It appears that most studies undertaken so far rely heavily on parametric approach, with single parameter being investigated while the others are kept constant during the optimization process. This opens the door for further use of advanced optimization techniques able to deal with parameters varying simultaneously, together with conflicting objectives, in order to identify global optimal solutions potentially more effective.}

  abstract = {During the past two decades the thermoacoustic refrigeration and prime mover cycles gained importance in a variety of refrigeration applications. Acoustic work, sound, can be used to generate temperature differences that allow the transport of heat from a low temperature reservoir to an ambient at higher temperature, thus forming a thermoacoustic refrigeration system. The thermoacoustic energy pumping cycle can also be reversed: temperature difference imposed along the stack plates can lead to sound generation. In this situation the thermoacoustic system operates as a prime mover. Sound generated by means of this thermoacoustic energy conversion process can be utilized to drive different types of refrigeration devices that require oscillatory flow for their operation, such as thermoacoustic refrigerators, pulse tubes and Stirling engines. In order for a thermoacoustic refrigeration or prime mover system as well as a thermoacoustic prime mover driving a non-thermoacoustic refrigeration system to be competitive on the current market, it has to be optimized in order to improve its overall performance. Optimization can involve improving the performance of the entire system as well as its components. The paper addresses some of the thermodynamic and heat transfer issues relevant in improving the performance of the thermoacoustic system, such as optimization for maximum COP, maximum cooling load and the role of the heat exchangers. Results obtained using the two optimization criteria are contrasted in the paper to illustrate the complexity of the optimization process.},

  abstract = {As a new type of refrigeration technology, the traveling-wave thermoacoustic refrigerator offers advantages that include high efficiency, reliability and environmental friendliness. To date, because of problems such as low power utilization and high power recovery losses, traveling-wave thermoacoustic refrigerators for use in room temperature applications have not been widely studied. In this paper, following an investigation of the traditional single-stage traveling-wave thermoacoustic refrigerator, a multi-stage traveling-wave thermoacoustic refrigerator is proposed and the working mechanism of this refrigerator is studied numerically using SAGE software. The calculation results show that the proposed multi-stage traveling-wave thermoacoustic refrigerator can enhance the utilization of the input acoustic work effectively, thereby improving the cooling power of the refrigerator with high cooling efficiency. As a result, the cooling power increases from 2.17 kW for a single-stage refrigerator to 6.42 kW for a seven-stage refrigerator, while the acoustic work utilization rate increases from 0.26 to 0.82, and the coefficient of performance changes from 2.60 to 3.19. The calculation results also indicate that three to five stages may be most suitable for the multi-stage traveling-wave thermoacoustic refrigerator when working within the temperature range of interest here by striking a balance between cooling efficiency and cooling power.}

  abstract = {In this paper, a thermally-driven thermoacoustic refrigerator system without any moving part is reported. This refrigeration system consists of a thermoacoustic-Stirling heat engine and a thermoacoustic-Stirling refrigerator; that is, the former is the driving source for the latter. Both the subsystems are designed to operate on traveling-wave mode. In the experiment, it was found that the DC-flows had significant negative effect on the heat engine and the refrigerator. To suppress these DC-flows, two flexible membranes were inserted into the two subsystems and worked very well. Then extensive experiments were made to test the influence of different parameters on refrigeration performance of the whole system. The system has so far achieved a no-load temperature of −65°C, a cooling capacity of about 270W at −20°C and 405W at 0°C; in fact, the result showed a good prospect of the refrigeration system in room-temperature cooling such as food refrigeration and air-conditioning.}

The coefficient of performance (COP), i.e., the ratio of cooling power to input power, of the refrigerator was calculated by varying the position, length, and flow-channel radius of the regenerator. When the three factors were simultaneously optimized, the COP was found to exceed 60 of the Carnot COP.}},

However, there are several sub-regions that exist in the transition between primary regions and at the heat reject interfaces of the Cooler Compressor Assembly (CCA) and Cooler Control Electronics Assembly (CCEA). The design and performance of the test facility to provide a flight representative thermal environment for acceptance testing and characterization of the complete MIRI cooler subsystem are presented.}

The stack is one of the most important parts of the thermoacoustic systems. It can have different geometries, like parallel plates, circular pores, or pin arrays. However, the fabrication of stacks with regular geometries is sometimes impractical due to material and assembly costs. These problems can be solved by using stack fabricated with random and easily accessible porous materials. In this paper an experimental investigation on the thermoacoustic effect in easily accessible porous materials is presented. The measurements with the stacks were made in a standing wave device filled with air at atmospheric pressure. The reported results confirm that some of the materials with high porosity can be an alternative to a traditional stack geometries and materials.},

  abstract = {This paper considers the role of acoustic impedance, flow resistance, configuration and geometrical dimensions of regenerators on the power produced in travelling-wave thermoacoustic engines. The effects are modelled assuming a pure travelling-wave and ideal gas, which allows defining a pair of dimensionless factors based on the “net” acoustic power production. Based on the analysis provided, the acoustic power flow in the regenerators is investigated numerically. It is shown that impedance essentially reflects the proportion between the acoustic power produced from heat energy through the thermoacoustic processes and the acoustic power dissipated by viscous and thermal-relaxation effects in the regenerators. Viscous resistance of the regenerator mainly determines the magnitude of the volumetric velocity and then affects the magnitude of acoustic impedance. High impedance and high volumetric velocity are both required in the regenerators for high power engines. The results also show that the optimum transverse dimension of the gas passage exists, but depends on the local acoustic impedance. In principle, it is possible to obtain an optimum combination between these two parameters.}
