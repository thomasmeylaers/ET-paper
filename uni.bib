  abstract = {Electrical and mechanical power, together with other forms of useful work, are generated worldwide at a rate of about 1012 watts, mostly using heat engines. The efficiency of such engines is limited by the laws of thermodynamics and by practical considerations such as the cost of building and operating them. Engines with high efficiency help to conserve fossil fuels and other natural resources, reducing global-warming emissions and pollutants. In practice, the highest efficiencies are obtained only in the most expensive, sophisticated engines, such as the turbines in central utility electrical plants. Here we demonstrate an inexpensive thermoacoustic engine that employs the inherently efficient Stirling cycle1. The design is based on a simple acoustic apparatus with no moving parts. Our first small laboratory prototype, constructed using inexpensive hardware (steel pipes), achieves an efficiency of 0.30, which exceeds the values of 0.10--0.25 attained in other heat engines5,6 with no moving parts. Moreover, the efficiency of our prototype is comparable to that of the common internal combustion engine2 (0.25--0.40) and piston-driven Stirling engines3,4 (0.20--0.38).},

  abstract = {{A new type of thermoacoustic engine based on traveling waves and ideally reversible heat transfer is described. Measurements and analysis of its performance are presented. This new engine outperforms previous thermoacoustic engines, which are based on standing waves and intrinsically irreversible heat transfer, by more than 50. At its most efficient operating point, it delivers 710 W of acoustic power to its resonator with a thermal efficiency of 0.30, corresponding to 41 of the Carnot efficiency. At its most powerful operating point, it delivers 890 W to its resonator with a thermal efficiency of 0.22. The efficiency of this engine can be degraded by two types of acoustic streaming. These are suppressed by appropriate tapering of crucial surfaces in the engine and by using additional nonlinearity to induce an opposing time-averaged pressure difference. Data are presented which show the nearly complete elimination of the streaming convective heat loads. Analysis of these and other irreversibilities show which components of the engine require further research to achieve higher efficiency. Additionally, these data show that the dynamics and acoustic power flows are well understood, but the details of the streaming suppression and associated heat convection are only qualitatively understood.}},

  abstract = {{We ordinarily think of a sound wave in a gas as consisting of coupled pressure and displacement oscillations. However, temperature oscillations always accompany the pressure changes. The combination of all these oscillations, and their interaction with solid boundaries, produces a rich variety of “thermoacoustic” effects. Although these effects as they occur in everyday life are too small to be noticed, one can harness extremely loud sound waves in acoustically sealed chambers to produce powerful heat engines, heat pumps and refrigerators. Whereas typical engines and refrigerators have crankshaft‐coupled pistons or rotating turbines, thermoacoustic engines and refrigerators have at most a single flexing moving part (as in a loudspeaker) with no sliding seals. Thermoacoustic devices may be of practical use where simplicity, reliability or low cost is more important than the highest efficiency (although one cannot say much more about their cost‐competitiveness at this early stage).}},

The manufacturing of the different components of the apparatus will be explained along with the reasons for using specific materials. The setup consists of three major parts: The refrigerator which is contained in a vacuum vessel, the electronic apparatus necessary for the measurements and acquisition of the experimental data, and the gas-control panel which is used to fill and purge the system and to prepare gas mixtures. The system is assembled and the first measurements show a good behavior. A low temperature of −65 °C is achieved which is one of the lowest reported temperatures up to date.}

  abstract = {{Since the power density in a thermoacoustic device is proportional to the square of the acoustic Mach number, there is strong motivation to design thermoacoustic refrigerators to operate at larger pressure amplitudes. Measurements are reported of a modified version of the Space Thermo-Acoustic Refrigerator (STAR), driven at peak-to-mean pressure ratios up to 6. This pressure ratio corresponds to 30 W of cooling power—five times as large as reported for STAR in 1993. The results of these measurements are compared to a DELTAE computer model of the low-amplitude (linear) performance that matches experimental conditions on a point-by-point basis. It is found that there is a small but measurable deviation in heat pumping power from the power predicted with a linear acoustic computer model at moderate amplitudes. This deviation in heat pumping power at 6 pressure ratio is about 23. A large disagreement in the acoustic power needed to attain a specific pressure ratio is found between measured data and DELTAE results. An overview of the instrumentation, including a measurement of exhaust heat with an absolute accuracy of 65 mW, is also presented.}},

Inventions of traveling wave thermoacoustic engines and traveling wave thermoacoustic refrigerators with work recovery capability have greatly improved the thermodynamic efficiencies of the thermoacoustic systems. To fully utilize the advantages of traveling wave systems, a traveling wave work-recoverable thermoacoustic refrigerator has been designed and built that is driven by a traveling wave thermoacoustic engine, which is aimed at domestic refrigeration purposes. So far, the lowest temperature of −64.4°C and 250W cooling power at −22.1°C are obtained by the system with 3.0MPa helium gas and 57.7Hz working frequency. Heat input into the system is 2.2kW. Simulations based on linear thermoacoustic theory have also been done for comparison with experimental results, which shows reasonable agreement within a certain pressure wave amplitude range and cold end temperature range. The comparisons meanwhile imply some serious loss mechanism inside the traveling wave thermoacoustic refrigerator.}},

  abstract = {Concerns over environmental impacts of hazardous refrigerants have spurred much research into alternative technologies as well as more environmentally friendly refrigerants. A thermoacoustic refrigeration system uses no refrigerant but is currently not a feasible solution due to the still immature technology with much still unknown about the theories that explain the thermoacoustc cooling effects and the desired performance. This paper reviews past studies to achieve the desired outputs; lowest temperature, the highest temperature difference generated across the stack, the lowest acoustical work required for cooling, or/and the highest coefficient of performance (COP) of the standing wave thermoacoustic refrigerator and various attempts at optimization in terms of the many parameters that represent the outcomes. The review looked at methods employed to analyze the performance with discussions on the relevant parameters that must and have been be considered by past researchers. To date, most studies have been focused on the stack, the heart of the system. Optimization work has been performed parametrically, experimentally or/and numerically, where discrete variations of the parameters investigated are completed whilst others are held constant. Lately, genetic algorithm, a statistical approach, has been utilized in simultaneous optimization of the parameters of the desired outputs where conflicting objectives are possible. To date, thermoacoustic refrigerator remains an attractive alternative technology towards a global agenda of a more sustainable future.}
