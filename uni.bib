  abstract = {Electrical and mechanical power, together with other forms of useful work, are generated worldwide at a rate of about 1012 watts, mostly using heat engines. The efficiency of such engines is limited by the laws of thermodynamics and by practical considerations such as the cost of building and operating them. Engines with high efficiency help to conserve fossil fuels and other natural resources, reducing global-warming emissions and pollutants. In practice, the highest efficiencies are obtained only in the most expensive, sophisticated engines, such as the turbines in central utility electrical plants. Here we demonstrate an inexpensive thermoacoustic engine that employs the inherently efficient Stirling cycle1. The design is based on a simple acoustic apparatus with no moving parts. Our first small laboratory prototype, constructed using inexpensive hardware (steel pipes), achieves an efficiency of 0.30, which exceeds the values of 0.10--0.25 attained in other heat engines5,6 with no moving parts. Moreover, the efficiency of our prototype is comparable to that of the common internal combustion engine2 (0.25--0.40) and piston-driven Stirling engines3,4 (0.20--0.38).},

  abstract = {{We ordinarily think of a sound wave in a gas as consisting of coupled pressure and displacement oscillations. However, temperature oscillations always accompany the pressure changes. The combination of all these oscillations, and their interaction with solid boundaries, produces a rich variety of “thermoacoustic” effects. Although these effects as they occur in everyday life are too small to be noticed, one can harness extremely loud sound waves in acoustically sealed chambers to produce powerful heat engines, heat pumps and refrigerators. Whereas typical engines and refrigerators have crankshaft‐coupled pistons or rotating turbines, thermoacoustic engines and refrigerators have at most a single flexing moving part (as in a loudspeaker) with no sliding seals. Thermoacoustic devices may be of practical use where simplicity, reliability or low cost is more important than the highest efficiency (although one cannot say much more about their cost‐competitiveness at this early stage).}},

  abstract = {This paper deals with the construction and performance of a thermoacoustic refrigerator. The manufacturing of the different components of the apparatus will be explained along with the reasons for using specific materials. The setup consists of three major parts: The refrigerator which is contained in a vacuum vessel, the electronic apparatus necessary for the measurements and acquisition of the experimental data, and the gas-control panel which is used to fill and purge the system and to prepare gas mixtures. The system is assembled and the first measurements show a good behavior. A low temperature of −65 °C is achieved which is one of the lowest reported temperatures up to date.}

Due to the large number of parameters, a choice of some parameters along with dimensionless independent variables will be introduced.

The optimization of the different parts of the refrigerator will be discussed, and criteria will be given to obtain an optimal system.}
